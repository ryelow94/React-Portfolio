                I am a full stack web developer with a background in financial services planning to leverage my experience working at a stock brokerage firm to develop scalable web solutions for every day business needs. I recently earned a full stack web developer certification via University of Oregon, and have achieved proficiency in skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and more. Known as a good communicator and collaborator, I hope to use these skills to be an integral part of a development team. Iâ€™m currently working with a team to revamp and modernize the website of a member firm (FINRA & SIPC) with the goal of achieving an intuitive UI in order to help the company better serve their clients. As a former financial adviser and operations manager, I have become well aware of the impact a well designed website can have on the day to day functions of a business. Having this awareness, I am excited to use my perspective to create meaningful and affective web solutions.
