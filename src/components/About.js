                I'm new to programming, but I'm enjoying the process of learning to code! I'm currently in University of Oregon's (Trilogy) fulll stack coding bootcamp. Before learning the code I worked in various other industries from service to finance. If I'm not working I'm probably playing music, my absolute favorite thing to do!
