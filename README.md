This app is a single page portfolio built using React.js. It provides all the information about my work and expereience a potential employer would need to hire me. The app consists of a responsive navbar that will take the user to an about-me section, a portfolio section, contact page and a place to download my resume from google drive. Furthermore, in the footer; the app has links to relevant social media pages and my github account.
